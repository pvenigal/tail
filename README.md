# tail

## Implementing *tail* command on xv6
The traditional UNIX tail utility can print out lines from the end of a file. If the number of lines is not configured (i.e., tail FILE), tail would print out the last 10 lines of its input. Or we could trigger by calling tail -NUM FILE, for example tail -2 README to print the last 2 lines of the file README. 

This program implements the *tail* command in C for the xv6 operating system.

## Examples of the usage of tail:

> $ tail README<br>
To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make". On non-x86 or
 → non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will need to install a cross-compiler
 → gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF binaries. See
 → http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/tools.html. Then run "make
 → TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". To run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators. To run in
 → QEMU, run "make qemu".
To create a typeset version of the code, run "make xv6.pdf". This requires the "mpage"
 → utility. See http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage/.
